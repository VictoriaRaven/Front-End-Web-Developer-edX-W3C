          <h3>Summary of Lessons:</h3>
        <div class="summary" role="article">
          <p>Through this project, I learned how to apply essential CSS styling techniques to create a visually appealing and well-structured web page using CSS with HTML and how the differnt font styles, such as serif and sans-serif, enhance visuals. Since I experimented with various font colors to create contrast and emphasis, I also learned how to integrate different background styles, like gradients, to make the page more modern looking and also applying padding, margins, and borders to properly space and structure content for a user-friendly layout. By incorporating all these styles while adhering to a project rubric, I deepened my understanding of both CSS and how to design a web page HTML that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

          <h3>Q & A (1): Sub Title 1</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How many of these HTML elements are on my page?
              <details>
                <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                <p>
                  In this specific HTML document, there are roughly <strong>32 HTML elements</strong> in total.  
                  That includes: <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>details</code>, <code>summary</code>, and <code>footer</code>.  
                  I believe it’s a clean, simple structure for easy styling, but detailed enough to demonstrate nesting and hierarchy concepts. This is good for modern basic blogging websites, similar to free versions of Wix or WordPress.
                </p>
              </details>
            </li>

            <li>
              Do I want this style to apply to every one of these elements?
              <details>
                <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                <p>
                  In my opinion, no, not exactly. Some elements like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> share consistent styling across the blog to be easier to read,  
                  but others like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> deserve unique changes to make it more modern-like.  
                  In my opinion, the P2-VictoriaRaven-styles-blog.css visual modifications improve the contrast, such as bold headers, soft (easy to read) body text, and interactive highlights (with answer key boxes).  
                  So I’d apply a different set of styles using class-based selectors or semantic sectioning rather than global tags, depending on what the website is targeting and my goals for it. Is it for a specific audience? Is it for professional usage or casual usage?

              What are this HTML element’s children?
              <details>
                <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                <p>
                  I can answer that based on this HTML for this page. By taking a look at this page:  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element is one example since its direct child is a <code>&lt;div class="page-wrapper"&gt;</code>.  
                  That wrapper contains two main sections: <code>.intro</code> and <code>.main</code>.  
                  Each of those has its own children: for instance, <code>.intro</code> includes a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;div class="summary"&gt;</code>,  
                  while <code>.main</code> contains <code>.preamble</code>, <code>.explanation</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.  
                  This webpage meets the requirements of a top-down hierarchy, demonstrating a readable, modern, and simple look for a blog post. It is quite similar to Google Blogger or even Tumblr format.

            <li>
              Do I want this style to apply to them as well?

                <p>
                  In the overall picture of website development, yes, for most of those styles (depending on the scenario), cascading is part of CSS.  
                  But in some cases, sometimes I want to prevent inheritance (for example, resetting link colors inside the footer).  
                  So far, on this website, I like the idea of reasonable, deliberate exceptions when clarity or focus matters in blogging. The point is that it depends on the audience you are catering to and what website it is for. Since this is a blog, I would make the font and words matter more than the background, to prevent distractions that keep users from reading the page. Since most people have an attention span that is less than 2 minutes for reading online pages, it is best to make it less fancy to avoid distractions and make the user read the page (text) matter most. Similar to the New York Times articles now posted or even Government websites (simplistic), it is easily readable and less likely to cause a shorter attention span for other users due to distractions.

            <li>
              Is this element a block element or an inline element?

                <p>
                  In this HTML page I created for this blog test page, most of the elements — like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> — are <strong>block elements</strong>.  
                  The inline ones are mostly <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and text within <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>.  
                  I think that’s a good balance as it demonstrates block layout for structure and inline snippets for emphasis.
                </p>
              </details>
            </li>

            <li>
              Does this style make sense in that context?
              <details>
                <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                <p>
                  Yes, I believe so, since every color, border, and font choice in the VictoriaRaven style blog fits its context and theme: a classic blog aesthetic that is easily readable and non-distracting, helping readers stay (without a shorter attention span).  
                  Cream tones, serif typography, and gentle borders complement the content’s educational nature, which is why good CSS styles matter: they should match the theme or target audience and feel natural without being awkward.
